  <h1><code>ringbuf.js</code> examples </h1>
  <div>
    <p>
      <code>ringbuf.js</code> is a single-producer single-consumer wait-free ring
      buffer written in JavaScript, that uses <code>SharedArrayBuffer</code>s to
      allow non-blocking communication between the main thread of a web
      application, Web Workers, and an AudioWorkletGlobalScope.
    </p>
    <p>
      After an initial phase of setup, it is possile to read and write from and
      to the ring buffer without causing any garbage collection or making any
      allocations, making it particularly suitable for high-performance
      communication in real-time audio processing scenario.
    </p>
    <p>
      When not used in a real-time context, a slighly more user-friendly API can
      be used, at the expense of very minimal generation of garbage, that is
      often acceptable with current garbage collector implementations.

    The source code of the library and a ready-to-use package are available at:
    <ul>
      <li> <a href=https://github.com/padenot/ringbuf.js>https://github.com/padenot/ringbuf.js</a>
      <li> <a href=https://www.npmjs.com/package/ringbuf.js>https://www.npmjs.com/package/ringbuf.js</a>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>
    The generated documentation is available at <a href=/doc/>/doc/</a>.

    The examples (generously commented) are deployed at <a
      href=https://ringbuf-js.netlify.app/>https://ringbuf-js.netlify.app/</a>,
    but cloning the repository and using the sample <code>node.js</code> server
    <code>server.js</code> at the room of the repository and navigating to
    <code>example/</code> works just as well.

    Two examples are avaible on this page:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="/example/main-thread-to-audioworklet/">Sending audio from the main thread to an AudioWorkletNode</a>
      <li><a href="/example/audioworklet-to-worker/">Getting audio out of an AudioWorkletNode</a>
